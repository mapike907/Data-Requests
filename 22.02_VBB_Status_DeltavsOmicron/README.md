# VBB Status: Delta vs. Omicron

This data analysis was performed in February 2022.

# Questions: 

(1) How have cases changed between vaccinated, vaccinated with booster, and unvaccinated between Delta (July 2021 to November 2021) and Omicron (December 2021 to January 2022)?
(1a) What percentage were vaccinated, vaccinated with booster, or unvaccinated?

(2) How have hospitalizations and deaths changed between Delta and Omicron? 
(2a) Which age group is more susceptible to hospitalization and death? 
(2b) What percentage of these groups were vaccinated, vaccinated with a booster, or unvaccinated? 

# Answers: 

### /** CASES **/

The graph on the left is Colorado's COVID-19 cases by vaccination status from July 2021 to January 2022. The graph on the right is from CDPHEâ€™s dashboard and shows variants of concern, with weekly proportions by specimen collection date. From July until mid-December, Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was in greatest proportion. Omicron (B.1.1.529) was detected in early December and by mid-December (week of 12/19) accounted for >50% of the weekly proportion of variants.

In Colorado, there is an increase in cases for all vaccination statuses in mid-December, as Omicron becomes >50% of the weekly proportion of variants.  

### _What percentage were vaccinated, vaccinated with booster, or unvaccinated?_

During July to December 2021, unvaccinated persons had a higher percentage of cases compared to those who are vaccinated or vaccinated with a booster dose. In response to the new Omicron variant, the CDC recommended additional booster doses to all adults 18 years old or older in late November. 

By January 2022, unvaccinated persons maintained a higher percentage of cases than among those vaccinated or vaccinated with a booster dose. As total cases increased with Omicron, vaccine breakthrough was more prevalant; however, data continues to show the vaccine is still effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death.

### /** HOSPITALIZATIONS **/

Among Colorado residents, unvaccinated persons had higher percentage of cases that require hospitalization compared to those vaccinated and vaccinated with booster during this time period. Between July 2021 and January 2022, hospitalizations were highest in November (Delta variant) and in January (Omicron variant). Vaccination continues to show protection against severe illness requiring hospitialization.

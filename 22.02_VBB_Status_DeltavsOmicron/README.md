The graph on the left is the COVID-19 Cases by Vaccination status from July 2021 to January 2022. The graph on the right is from CDPHEâ€™s dashboard and shows variants of concern, with weekly proportions by specimen collection date. We can see that from July until mid-December, Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was in greatest proportion. Omicron (B.1.1.529) was detected in early December and by mid-December (week of 12/19) accounted for >50% of the weekly proportion of variants.
